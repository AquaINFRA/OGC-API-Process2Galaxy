<tool id="SAGA.grid_filter.11" name="Resampling Filter" version="1.0.0"><description>Resampling filter for grids. Resamples in a first step the given grid to desired resampling cell size, expressed as multiple of the original cell size (scale factor). This is an up-scaling through which cell values are aggregated as cell area weighted means. Second step is the down-scaling to original cell size using spline interpolation. Specially for larger search distances this is a comparably fast alternative for simple low and high pass filter operations. </description><inputs><param name="GRID" label="Grid" help="Grid" type="text" format="image/tiff, application/x-ogc-envi, application/x-ogc-aaigrid, image/png" /><param name="SCALE" label="Scale Factor" help="Scale Factor" type="float" format="image/tiff, application/x-ogc-envi, application/x-ogc-aaigrid, image/png" /></inputs><outputs><data name="LOPASS" label="Low Pass Filter" /><data name="HIPASS" label="High Pass Filter" /></outputs></tool>
