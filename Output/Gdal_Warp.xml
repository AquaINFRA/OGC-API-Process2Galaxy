<tool id="Gdal_Warp" name="GDAL Warp Tool" version="1.0.0"><description>The gdalwarp utility is an image mosaicing, reprojection and warping utility. The program can reproject to any supported projection, and can also apply GCPs stored with the image if the image is "raw" with control information.</description><inputs><param name="Format" label="Format of the output data" help="Select the output format by usig short name of the format (use gda-config --formats for list of available formats on your platform)." type="text" /><param name="InputDSN" label="The input data source name" help="The input data source name to use as source for convertion." type="text" /><param name="OutputDSN" label="The output data source name" help="The output data source name to use as source for convertion." type="text" /><param name="s_srs" label="The source Spatial reference Set" help="The coordinate systems that can be passed are anything supported by the OGRSpatialReference.SetFromUserInput() call, which includes EPSG PCS and GCSes (ie.
