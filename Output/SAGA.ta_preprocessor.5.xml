<tool id="SAGA.ta_preprocessor.5" name="Fill Sinks XXL (Wang &amp; Liu)" version="1.0.0"><description>This tool uses an algorithm proposed by Wang &amp; Liu to identify and fill surface depressions in digital elevation models.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The method was enhanced to allow the creation of hydrologic sound elevation models, i.e. not only to fill the depression(s) but also to preserve a downward slope along the flow path. If desired, this is accomplished by preserving a minimum slope gradient (and thus elevation difference) between cells.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This version of the tool is designed to work on large data sets (e.g. LIDAR data), with smaller datasets you might like to check out the fully featured standard version of the tool.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;References:&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Wang, L. &amp; H.
