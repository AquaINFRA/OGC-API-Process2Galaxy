<tool id="SAGA.grid_analysis.5" name="Least Cost Paths" version="1.0.0"><description>This tool allows one to compute least cost path profile(s). It takes an accumulated cost surface grid and a point shapefile as input. Each point in the shapefile represents a source for which the least cost path is calculated.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;In case the point shapefile has more than one source point defined, a separate least cost path is calculated for each point. The tool outputs a point and a line shapefile for each least cost path.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; The tool allows for optional input grids. The cell values of these grids along the least cost path are written to the outputs as additional table fields.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;</description><inputs><param name="SOURCE" label="Source Point(s)" help="Point shapefile with source point(s)" type="data" format="text/xml, application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml" /><param name="DEM" label="Accumulated Cost Surface" help="Accumulated Cost Surface" type="text" format="image/tiff, application/x-ogc-envi, application/x-ogc-aaigrid, image/png" /><param name="VALUES" label="Values" help="Allows writing cell values from additional grids to the output" type="text" format="image/tiff, application/x-ogc-envi, application/x-ogc-aaigrid, image/png" /></inputs><outputs><data name="POINTS" label="Profile Points" /><data name="LINE" label="Profile Lines" /></outputs></tool>
