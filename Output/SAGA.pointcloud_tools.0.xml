<tool id="SAGA.pointcloud_tools.0" name="Point Cloud Cutter" version="1.0.0"><description>This tool allows one to extract subsets from one or several point cloud datasets. The area-of-interest is defined either by bounding box coordinates, the extent of a grid system or a shapes layer, or by polygons of a shapes layer. Note that the latter does not support the inverse selection in case the shapes layer contains more than one polygon.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;In case a polygon shapes layer is used and one or more polygons are selected, only the selected polygons are processed.</description><inputs><param name="POINTS" label="Points" help="One or several input point cloud datasets to cut." type="text" format="application/x-ogc-lasf" /><param name="AREA" label="Choose Cut from ..." help="Choose Cut from ..." type="text" format="application/x-ogc-lasf" /><param name="INVERSE" label="Inverse" help="Invert selection." type="boolean" format="application/x-ogc-lasf" /></inputs><outputs><data name="CUT" label="Cut" /></outputs></tool>
