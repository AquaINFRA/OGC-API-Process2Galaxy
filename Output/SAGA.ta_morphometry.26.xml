<tool id="SAGA.ta_morphometry.26" name="Upslope and Downslope Curvature" version="1.0.0"><description>This tool first calculates the local curvature of a cell as sum of the gradients (i.e. tangens of slope) to its neighbour cells. This is a simple estimation of the general curvature and is strongly correlated with general curvatures calculated with other methods (e.g. Zevenbergen &amp; Thorne 1987). Then upslope curvature is calculated as the distance and flow proportional weighted average local curvature over a cell's upslope contributing area following the multiple flow direction algorithm after Freeman (1991). In a similar way the downslope curvature is calculated by summarizing the curvatures of all hydrologically downslope connected cells. The local upslope/downslope curvatures just take the immediately neighboured cells into account. </description><inputs><param name="DEM" label="Elevation" help="Elevation" type="text" format="image/tiff, application/x-ogc-envi, application/x-ogc-aaigrid, image/png" /><param name="WEIGHTING" label="Upslope Weighting" help="Upslope Weighting" type="float" format="image/tiff, application/x-ogc-envi, application/x-ogc-aaigrid, image/png" /></inputs><outputs><data name="C_LOCAL" label="Local Curvature" /><data name="C_UP" label="Upslope Curvature" /><data name="C_UP_LOCAL" label="Local Upslope Curvature" /><data name="C_DOWN" label="Downslope Curvature" /><data name="C_DOWN_LOCAL" label="Local Downslope Curvature" /></outputs></tool>
