<tool id="SAGA.ta_preprocessor.4" name="Fill Sinks (Wang &amp; Liu)" version="1.0.0"><description>This tool uses an algorithm proposed by Wang &amp; Liu to identify and fill surface depressions in digital elevation models.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The method was enhanced to allow the creation of hydrologic sound elevation models, i.e. not only to fill the depression(s) but also to preserve a downward slope along the flow path. If desired, this is accomplished by preserving a minimum slope gradient (and thus elevation difference) between cells.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;This is the fully featured version of the tool creating a depression less DEM, a flow path grid and a grid with watershed basins. If you encounter problems processing large data sets (e.g. LIDAR data) with this tool try the basic version (Fill Sinks XXL).&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;References:&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Wang, L. &amp; H.
