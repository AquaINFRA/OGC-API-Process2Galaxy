<tool id="SAGA.grid_analysis.6" name="Change Vector Analysis" version="1.0.0"><description>This tool performs a change vector analysis (CVA) for the given input features. Input features are supplied as grid lists for initial and final state. In both lists features have to be given in the same order. Distance is measured as Euclidean distance in features space. When analyzing two features direction is calculated as angle (radians) by default. Otherwise direction is coded as the quadrant it points to in terms of feature space. </description><inputs><param name="A" label="Initial State" help="Initial State" type="text" format="image/tiff, application/x-ogc-envi, application/x-ogc-aaigrid, image/png" /><param name="B" label="Final State" help="Final State" type="text" format="image/tiff, application/x-ogc-envi, application/x-ogc-aaigrid, image/png" /><param name="ANGLE" label="Angle Calculation" help="angle calculation is only available when exact two features are compared" type="boolean" format="image/tiff, application/x-ogc-envi, application/x-ogc-aaigrid, image/png" /><param name="C_OUT" label="Output of Change Vector" help="Output of Change Vector" type="boolean" format="image/tiff, application/x-ogc-envi, application/x-ogc-aaigrid, image/png" /></inputs><outputs><data name="DIST" label="Distance" /><data name="DIR" label="Direction" /><data name="C" label="Change Vector" /></outputs></tool>
